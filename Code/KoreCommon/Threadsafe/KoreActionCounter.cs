/*
KoreActionCounter: An approach that uses atomic operations with Interlocked to ensure thread safety
without a full lock. In this example, the TryConsume method uses a CAS (compare-and-swap) loop to
safely decrement the counter only if itâ€™s positive, and Refresh atomically sets the new total

TryConsume: The method reads the current count, and if it's greater than zero, attempts to decrement
it. The CAS loop ensures that if another thread updates the count simultaneously, it will retry until
it succeeds.

Refresh: This method atomically sets the counter to a new value using Interlocked.Exchange, ensuring
any ongoing operations see a consistent update.

This design provides a simple, thread-safe counter suitable for use cases like token-based load balancing.
